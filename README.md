#  Self-interview to finish my task.
My name is jeff ,some of my hobbies just as follows:

* code
* make money
* eat something delicious
* play computer games like counter strike

I have learned some code languages like Java,C,C++, but was not good at any of them
I have complex feeling abour the C,beacuse it's really hard to be really good at it ,but I think it's the best language to describe Algorithm and Data Structure,which i think are very vital to each coder.


I can show you some simple code edited by C .

 ```C
     int N;
     double sum;
     scanf("%d",&N);
     for(int i=1;i<=N;i++){
          	
           sum+=pow(-1,i+1)*(double)i/(2*i-1);
     }
     
     printf("%.3lf",sum);
    return 0;
 ```
 
 Now that i will devote all my efforts to learn Html&CSS&JavaScript.
 
Just come on !!!!

Thanks for your time.
